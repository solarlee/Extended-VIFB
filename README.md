This is the official webpage of Extenden-VIFB. 

**Extenden-VIFB is a larger  benchmark in the field of visible-infrared image fusion (VIF)**, aiming to provide a platform to perform fair and comprehensive performance comparision of VIF algorithms. Currently, **56 image pairs, 32 fusion algorithms and 16 evaluation metrics** are integrated in VIFB, which can be utilized to compare performances conveniently. All the fusion results are also available that can be used by users directly. In addition, more test images, fusion algorithms (in Matlab), evaluation metrics and fused images can be easily added using the provided toolkit.

## Abstract
Infrared and visible image fusion is an important area in the computer vision field due to its numerous applications. In recent years, much progress has been made for developing image fusion algorithms. However, there is a lack of code library and benchmark which can be used to evaluate the state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, after briefly revisiting recent advances of infrared and visible image fusion methods, we present an extended VIFB (Visible and Infrared Image Fusion Benchmark) for infrared and visible image fusion, which include 56 image pairs, a code library of 32 fusion algorithms and 16 evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark to understand the performance of these different algorithms. We also analyze the qualitative and quantitative of different fusion results and identify effective algorithms for robust image fusion. Finally, we look forward to the future prospects of infrared and visible image fusion field.
